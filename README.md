The converted values will be displayed on the webpage.

# How to Use

2. **Unit Selection**: Select the current unit of the input temperature value from the drop-down list labeled "Select Temperature Unit." You can choose from Fahrenheit, Celsius, or Kelvin.

3. **Conversion**: After entering the temperature value and selecting the unit, click on the "Calculate" button to perform the conversion.

4. **Results**: The converted temperature values will be displayed in the three input fields labeled "Value In Celsius," "Value In Fahrenheit," and "Value In Kelvin." Each input field will show the converted value for the corresponding temperature unit.
